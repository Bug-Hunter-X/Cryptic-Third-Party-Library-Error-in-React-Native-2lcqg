This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly configured or compatible with your React Native project.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message during compilation or runtime, failing to clearly pinpoint the source of the issue. This might involve missing native modules, incorrect linkage, or incompatibilities between library versions and your React Native version or other dependencies.
