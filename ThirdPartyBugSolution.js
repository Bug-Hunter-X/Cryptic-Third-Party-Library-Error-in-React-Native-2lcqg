To solve this, carefully review the documentation for the third-party library. Ensure you've installed all necessary dependencies and followed the integration instructions precisely. Verify compatibility between the library version, React Native version, and other dependencies. Check your project's configuration files (like `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/Podfile`) for any potential errors. Cleaning the project and reinstalling dependencies can also be helpful.  If the library uses native modules, ensure those are properly linked and built. If the issue persists, check the library's issue tracker for similar reports or seek assistance from the community.
